# âš› React Chrome Connect &nbsp;![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/tailwindcss-cmdk.svg)

- For [Manifest V3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/mv3-overview/)
- See [message passing long lived connections](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/messaging/#connect)
- Needs React 18 (uses [`useId`](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useId))

  - Works with SSR

- If using this in a web app to communicate with an extension then the [`externally_connectable`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/externally_connectable/) manifest property should contain a match for the url your app is running on
  - If it doesn't then nothing will break but no port will be opened - this is the same behavior as if there were no extension installed).
- You'll see an error logged if there is an extension that lists your url in the `externally_connectable` property but you pass an id that doesn't match an available extension (one with your url in the `externally_connectable` property)
